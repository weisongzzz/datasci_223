  Hi, I am Weisong Zhang. I am a Master's student studying Health Data Science. I enjoy programming, and I know R, 
Python and Matlab. I am interested in learning Machine Learning and adopting the skills to create my own workflow.
I am working by myself for this term. 
  Hope for learning outcome: 
      1. Advanced skills on problem solving with programming
      2. Writting efficient code with a deep understanding on concepts and attention to details
      3. Ability to apply programming on real world tasks with control of risks.
  Difficulty in Exercise 1:
      1. Learning Python on Exercism is not time-efficient due to insufficient tutorial on knowledge that is 
         required to complete the modules. Providing documents of functions would help.
